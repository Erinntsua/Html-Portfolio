<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Erin Dzifa Ntsua, a Level 200 IT student at the University of Ghana. I'm currently diving deep into frontend development, sharpening my skills in JavaScript while building on my HTML and CSS knowledge. I'm also exploring Virtual Assistance (VA) as part of my studies.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m working on a traveling and booking e-commerce website that highlights Ghana’s culture, food, and regional colors. I love bringing creative ideas to life through tech, and I’m always looking for ways to improve my craft.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I enjoy watching K-dramas with deep storylines and realistic romance. My weekends are usually packed with house chores, but I’m trying to fit in more study time to stay on top of everything.</p>
